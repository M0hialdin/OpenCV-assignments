# Camera Calibration using Python with OpenCV

## A fully functional code that calibrate camera using chess board images

This application only goal is to calibrate the camera using chess board inner squire angles, I've made this project as a way for me to learn more about computer vision, And picked Python combined with OpenCV library because they're both beginner-friendly and easy to have fun with.

### Installation instructions

**first you have to install OpenCV:**
Open your Command line as Administrator and type "pip install opencv-python", After that we are going to run this application...  
The easiest way is just to have/Install Visual Studio Code at your machine and then download and open this project at your VSCode and run it from there!  

BUt here it's the easiest way for a different type of people:  
Open your command-line again" and do the next:  
1. **clone the repo:**  
   git clone https://github.com/M0hialdin/OpenCV-assignments.git  
2. **go inside the folder where the code is:**  
   cd OpenCV-assignments  
3. **Run the code:**  
   Camera_Calibration.py

### Usage example

This project does one thing only: **calibrating a camera using a chessboard pattern**. Here’s how to use it:

**Step 1: Take photos**  
Capture multiple photos of a real chessboard from different angles. The more images you take, the more accurate the calibration will be. Typically, 10–15 clean images are enough.

**Step 2: Place files**  
Put all the photos in the same folder as the code. When you run the program, it will process each image and return the same set of photos with the **inner squares marked and detected**.

**Step 3: Run the code**  
python Camera_Calibration.py
